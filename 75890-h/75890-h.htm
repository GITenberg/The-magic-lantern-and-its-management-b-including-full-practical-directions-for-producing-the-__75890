<p><span class="smcap large">During</span> the past few years, the introduction
of a dry-plate photographic process of such
a nature that it can be practised successfully
by amateurs of both sexes has aroused an
amount of interest in the camera and its capabilities,
such as few scientific instruments can
command. The Magic Lantern is now closely
allied with the camera, for there is no means
of showing the perfection of a photographic
picture so well as by its aid. But many
persons are deterred from adopting the latter
contrivance because they fancy that there
must be innumerable difficulties to surmount
before they can hope to master its management.
It is for these that the following
pages have been written, in which I have
tried to place clearly before the reader what
can be done, and how to do it. I have also
tried to indicate the educational value of the
lantern, and have pointed out in a necessarily
brief manner how various branches of
knowledge can be illustrated by its aid. The
numerous personal inquiries addressed to me
after my lectures, and the numbers of letters
constantly received, asking for information
regarding the lantern, its management, and
the preparation of lantern slides, have convinced
me that there is room for a manual,
humble though it be, dealing with these
subjects.</p>

</div>

<p class="c large"><i>AND ITS MANAGEMENT</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">There</span> is no optical instrument so well known
or so highly held in popular estimation as the
Magic Lantern. It is somewhat unfortunate
that its old appellation, given to it when it was
nothing more than a mere toy, should have
stuck to it so long. And more than one
attempt has been made by those conversant
with its capabilities as a scientific instrument,
and as an important aid to education, to give
it a name more consistent with its real value.
The late Mr. Dalmeyer was, I believe, the first
to re-christen it the ‘Optical Lantern;’ and there
is evidence that others are adopting the term,
and that in time the old name will sink into
oblivion.</p>

<p>With regard to the early history of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
deservedly favourite contrivance, but little is
known. Its invention has been ascribed to
Friar Bacon, but the evidence on this point is
of the most legendary character. It seems,
however, certain that the first to give an intelligent
description of it was Kircher—a Jesuit
who lived two and a half centuries ago, and
who published a work entitled ‘Ars Magna
Lucis et Umbræ,’ or ‘The Great Art of Light
and Shadow.’ The body of the lantern, as
described by Kircher, consisted of a room
several feet across, furnished with an opening
in which a lens was placed. The source of
light was an oil-lamp, and the pictures for
exhibition were of the roughest kind. Indeed,
we may presume that the effects produced fell
far short of those attained by the cheapest toy
lantern of our schoolboy days. Even if we
search the columns of an Encyclopædia or any
similar book of reference of forty years ago, we
shall not find any great improvement on the
description afforded by Kircher. The magic
lantern will there be found described as ‘an
optical toy, by which glass pictures executed
with coloured varnishes can be thrown upon a
wall or screen.’</p>

<p>But from this time a gradual improvement
began. First, the old oil-lamp was replaced by
the argand burner; then came gas; finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
the brilliant lime-light—and some time in the
near future, perhaps, will come electricity. The
improved means of obtaining light have
naturally led to larger pictures being thrown
on the screen; for the size of such pictures is
governed only by the amount of light available.
Thus, supposing we own a modern
lantern constructed with one of the improved
three or four-wick lamps, and that it will give
us a good picture of about six feet diameter,
by using the same lantern, and without any
change whatever in its optical arrangements,
save fitting it with a lime-light jet, the disc
can be increased to fifteen feet diameter. A
picture of the same size could be produced
with the original lamp, provided that the
operator retired to the necessary distance from
the screen, but the light would be so attenuated
that the picture would be but a ghost of what
it ought to be. It will therefore be understood
that the enlarged image formed by the
lantern lens can be made to fall at any point
in front of that lens, and may be of any size;
but to render it practically available its size,
and therefore its distance from the lens, must
be regulated by the amount of light at disposal.</p>

<p>During the past few years two circumstances
have combined to render the optical lantern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
more popular than ever: one being the introduction
of photographic transparencies representing
scenes from the remotest parts of
the earth, and the other the construction of
metal-bodied lanterns of improved character,
and burning mineral oil. As a good paraffine
lamp is compared with a farthing rushlight, so
is one of these lanterns to the toy of our boyhood.
The light given, although it falls far
short of the brilliance of the lime-light, is
much more intense than could have been hoped
for some years ago from oil. But its brilliance
is not all due to the paraffine, but quite
as much to the careful ventilation and general
construction of the flame-chamber. There is,
too, no danger in the use of this form of lantern,
for the reservoir containing the paraffine is far
below the combustion-chamber, and therefore
it cannot become unduly heated.</p>

<p>The lenses, too, in this new form of lantern,
although placed in the same position as those
in the old-fashioned magic lantern, are of a
very different stamp. And this leads me to
a brief consideration of the optical system comprised
in these instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="lenses">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
<p class="caption">L, Light; <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, Condensing lenses; <i>o</i>, <i>o</i>, Objective lenses.</p>
</div>

<p>There are two sets of lenses: one being
known as the condenser, and the other as the
objective. The condenser is made up of two
or more glasses, the usual form consisting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>two plano-convex lenses placed face to face.
The duty of this condenser is to take up as
much as possible of the light afforded by the
lamp, and to change the direction of the rays
so that they are cast through the picture or
slide placed in front of it. A glance at Fig. 1.
will show how this is accomplished, and how
the rays indicated by the dotted lines would
be lost if not turned to account by the condenser.
The use of the objective, on the other
hand, is to magnify the image of the picture,
and to present it in as perfect a form as possible
on the screen placed for its reception. Its
distance from the picture is governed by the
distance of the lantern from the screen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
can be regulated to a nicety by the focusing
screw attached to it. It is generally acknowledged
by all acquainted with the requirements
of the lantern that the photographic camera
lens (known as the quarter-plate portrait lens)
fulfils admirably this duty; and this particular
form of lens, which is by no means expensive,
is generally fitted to modern lanterns of
the mineral-oil type. The condensers vary
from four to three inches in diameter; perhaps
the best size is three and a half inches. The
relative positions of condenser, light, slide,
and objective are indicated in the diagram
to which attention has just been called,
Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The optical lantern always inverts the image
of any picture projected by it, an inconvenience
readily obviated by placing the slide on the
stage upside down. At the same time the
picture must have its front turned towards the
condenser, not away from it, otherwise every
part of the slide suffers reversal on the screen.
In some cases this does not matter, but when
any wording, such as that on a signboard, for
instance, is contained in the picture, it reads
backwards. Such accidents can be prevented
by a white label, easily seen in semi-darkness,
placed in a certain position on the picture. If
such a precaution had been observed at a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
exhibition at which I was present, General
Garfield would not have been shown standing
on his head—not a dignified position for the
President of the American Republic.</p>

<p>The first lanterns, constructed to burn
mineral oils, were very different to those of
modern make, and took their pattern from
the cumbrous instruments which before them
were provided with colza-oil lamps. The
reservoir for the oil was carefully kept in
a cistern at the back of the lantern, and
bubbled through a pipe to the lamp on the
same principle that water is supplied to an
earthenware poultry fountain. It was doubtless
thought necessary in those days to
maintain the paraffine in the cistern at a height
equal to or above the wick, as in the case of
colza and other heavy oils. But paraffine is
more of the nature of a spirit—for it volatilizes
very readily—and in modern lamps for
lanterns the reservoir is kept some inches
below the point of combustion. By the time
that the liquid reaches this point, it has
become so heated in the course of its passage
along the metal wick-holders that it issues as
a gas. This can be readily proved by turning
down the wicks after the lantern has been
burning some time, when the flames will
remain above the wick-holders, although the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
wicks themselves have been turned down
quite out of reach. In the older lanterns, too,
the glass chimney was thought to be indispensable,
but now this has been done away
with, and with it the cylindrical wick has also
gone. The modern combustion-chamber is
made of charcoal iron, and is closed at one
end with a thin pane of glass, just outside
which the condensing lenses are placed, and
at the other end by a silver-plated reflector.
The necessary air to promote combustion is
admitted by suitable orifices below, and a
draught is established by a long iron chimney
above.</p>

<p>There is no great difficulty in managing
one of these lanterns. The loosely plaited
cotton wicks should in the first instance be
carefully cut parallel with the wick-holders.
After this they do not require much attention.
It is a far better plan to remove the charred
end of the wicks by scraping them along with
the back of a knife, than to be always cutting
them afresh. However, any loose strands
that may project from the cotton should be
certainly snipped off with scissors.</p>

<p>After lighting the lantern—which is best
done with a long wax taper—each wick should
be turned down quite low, and the combustion-chamber
closed. In about two minutes, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
which time the front glass and the lantern
generally will have become warmed, the wicks
should be turned up to their highest; that is
to say, to a pitch just short of smoking-point.
If the wicks are turned low for any length
of time the lamp will be sure to smell. It
will also smell if, in the process of charging
with oil, some of the liquid has been smeared
against any part of the lantern which may
afterwards become heated. The best oil only
should be used.</p>

<p>I have already hinted at the educational
value of the optical lantern, but those who
have not experimented with it have but a faint
idea of its capabilities in this respect. I am
of the opinion that every school and college
should possess one, and that both pupils and
teachers would soon discover its many advantages.
Now that it is manufactured in such
a portable and efficient form, and can be so
easily managed, there is no possible hindrance
to its adoption, unless it be its old name of
‘magic lantern,’ which is associated with
things too childish for consideration. But
this objection cannot hold good when it is
pointed out how many different branches of
knowledge can be illustrated by its use.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster of a London Board
School once told me of some of his difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
in teaching such a subject as geography.
Most of the children had never seen the sea,
and many of them had never even travelled
so far as the Thames. What notion could
such waifs have of a mountain, a valley, a
cliff, or even of a rock? The value of the
optical lantern at once becomes apparent here.
But better informed children in high-class
schools, although they see many places beyond
the London streets, can yet reap much advantage
from the mode of instruction which I am
advocating; and as the range of knowledge
increases, so will some such means of illustration
be forced upon teachers. The labour
and expense of tracing a dozen diagrams on
glass, in the way hereafter explained, is considerably
less than that involved in drawing a
single large diagram for the schoolroom wall.
By this easy method the illustrations in any
book can be roughly copied and rendered
available for an entire class.</p>

<p>In the higher branches of knowledge the
lantern can also give its help. Botany,
zoology, and natural history generally can be
illustrated by diagrams, photographs, and in
many cases by natural preparations. The
revelations of the microscope can be transferred
to the lantern, and the most complex
organisms can be seen clearly defined and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
magnified many hundred times their natural
size. It is possible, too, to show by the lantern
many interesting experiments in chemistry
and electricity which cannot be shown to a
large number of persons in any other way.
Let me cite for instance the formation of
crystals, which can actually be watched in
progress, highly magnified, by the simple
expedient of smearing a piece of glass with a
solution of sal ammoniac and placing it in the
lantern. There are several adjuncts which
may be fitted to a first-class lantern which I
have not space to notice in detail. With the
lantern-microscope ordinary microscopic slides
can be utilized, and tanks for containing the
living denizens of our ponds and ditches may
be employed. The marvels of polarised light
may be demonstrated with the lantern-polariscope.
By another special device called the
‘aphengescope’ and which is made to fit on
the lantern, opaque objects can be thrown on
the screen. It is possible, for instance, to
utilize ordinary photographs or diagrams on
card, to show the moving works of a watch,
sections of fruit, and many other objects as
explained in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The lantern, at the time of exhibition,
should stand firmly. It can, if it be a small
one burning oil, be placed on a box standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
upon a table. I myself prefer to place it on a
photographic tripod-stand, and this I effect
by screwing on to the top of the stand a base-board
upon which the lantern firmly fits. For
large lanterns, such as the lime-light biunial,
a far more solid arrangement is requisite.
My own method is this. The lantern screws
on to the top of its travelling-box, at the lower
corners of which are sockets to admit four
wrought-iron legs. These legs are bent outwards,
and what I may call their toes are
turned out, and have a hole into which a screw
may be inserted and driven into the floor. The
lantern is fastened to the box by two hinged
pieces at the back, so that the nozzles can be
raised to any extent desired.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="c2">THE LIME-LIGHT.</h2>
</div>


<p>The lime-light consists of a jet of mixed
hydrogen and oxygen gases under pressure,
ignited, and forced upon a cylinder of lime,
which it renders white-hot. The heat given
by these gases is second only to the heat of
the electric arc, and will melt that most refractory
of metals, platinum. Even the lime
block cannot withstand the great heat to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
which it is exposed, but is quickly pitted
under the action of the flame. Hence lime-light
jets are furnished with an arrangement
by which the lime cylinder can be turned at
frequent intervals, so as to offer a fresh surface
for the gases to play upon.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of jet used for the
lantern. Firstly, a jet in which a stream of
oxygen is forced through the flame of a spirit-lamp
on to a cylinder of lime. This form is
perfectly safe, and although it presents an immense
improvement upon any form of oil
arrangement, does not afford sufficient light
to illuminate a screen more than about nine
feet in diameter. Secondly, there is what is
known as the blow-through jet. In this case
the jet is connected with the house gas, and
the oxygen meets it at the point of ignition,
and is <i>blown through</i> it on to the lime. This
form of jet is also safe; indeed, it is often
called ‘the safety jet,’ and affords plenty of
light even for professional use. It is the
one that I recommend the amateur to work
with. Thirdly, there is the mixed jet, in
which the two gases in separate bags are both
under pressure, and mix together before reaching
the external orifice. This form of lime-light
gives the most light of any; but such
care is requisite in dealing with it, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
shall say no more about it, considering it unfit
for casual acquaintance.</p>

<p>A beginner might fancy that it would be
a simple thing to mix the two gases in one
bag, put it under pressure, and use them
thus. So it would, and a beautiful light
would be the result. Probably a beautiful
explosion would be another result, for the
two gases mixed form a most terrible compound,
and a bag so charged would be almost
equal in danger to a live shell.</p>

<p>With the spirit jet, or the ‘blow-through,’
the operator need have no fear of danger.
Oxygen is not an explosive, and, although
the best supporter of combustion, is not itself
capable of being ignited. The spirit jet I
should not recommend, except in situations
where coal gas is not obtainable, so in my
directions for using the lime-light, let it be
understood that I am considering the employment
of the blow-through, or safety jet.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, then, that we are preparing
for an exhibition. The gas is made, and is
at hand in the gas-bag; our lantern—and I
will, for simplicity’s sake, consider it a single
lantern only—is raised on its stand-table, or
other support, at a convenient height from
the ground, and we wish to have a private
rehearsal in order to see that all is right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
The first thing is to attach the hydrogen
terminal of the jet, marked H, by flexible
tubing to the nearest gas-bracket. Now take
a cylinder of lime from its box, clear out the
hole in the centre with a bit of wire, or a
match, and place it on the pin provided for
it above the jet. See that it turns freely, and
so adjust the pin that the lime is distant from
the jet nozzle about the sixteenth of an inch.
Light the gas, and turn it down so that the
flame is about an inch high. This can be
done with advantage an hour or more before
the lantern is really required, for the lenses
and body of the lantern will by this means
get thoroughly warmed, and any moisture upon
the glasses, which would show as a blemish
on the sheet, will be removed.</p>

<p>In all cases the hydrogen should be lighted
first, if only to thoroughly warm the lime.
Now the oxygen-bag can be put between the
pressure-boards, and connected by another
tube to the tap marked O. A half-hundred-weight
having been put on the boards, the
gas-bag tap may be turned on to the full.
We may now attend to the jet. Turn on the
hydrogen so that it flames up some inches
over the lime, then gradually turn on the
oxygen. At first it is air only that comes
away, but presently with a characteristic little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
snap the two gases come together, and the
brilliant lime-light is produced. A little care
in adjustment of each tap alternately will
soon show us the amount of gas from each
which will give the best result.</p>

<p>It will soon be apparent to the operator
that the spot of light on the lime must be
exactly in the axis of the system of lenses, or
the effect upon the sheet will be spoiled. The
vertical movement of the jet is governed by
a little screw, which holds it to the post on
which it is fixed, which post stands upon an
iron tray gliding between grooves. We must
raise or lower the jet until the right place is
found, when the screw can be brought home,
and the jet is fixed. Even now, most probably,
we shall find that the outer margin of
the disc is ill-defined. This shows that the
light is either too near or too far from the
condenser. By moving the jet on its tray
bodily backwards and forwards, we shall soon
be able to find its correct position, and when
found, that position will hold good to the
end of the exhibition. We can now put a
picture on the slide-stage, and focus it by
means of the screw on the front lens. If
the lime is properly adjusted and centred, our
picture will be illuminated equally well in
every part.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c3">DISSOLVING VIEWS.</h2>
</div>


<p>So far, we have considered the production
of a brilliantly illuminated picture with a
single lantern. For many years after the
lime-light came into use, this was all that
was required of it. But suddenly the beautiful
effect known as dissolving views was contrived—an
effect which, at the time of its
introduction, made a wonderful sensation—and
the method of producing which was for
a long time kept secret. The old way of dissolving
one picture into another, and the way
which must still be adopted if oil-lanterns are
in question, was to use two lanterns, side by
side, and by a kind of see-saw arrangement
in front of the lenses, to gradually uncover
one nozzle whilst the other was being closed.
This was easily done by furnishing each end
of the see-saw with a screen of tin, the edge
of each being cut into teeth like a comb.
The one picture was thus caused to mingle
with the other until the first lantern was
quite closed, when the new design became
perfectly disclosed. It soon became evident
that the same effect could be produced more
simply and economically with the lime-light
lanterns, by contriving a special form of gas-tap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
which would slowly turn off the gases
supplied to one lantern, while it as slowly
admitted the gases to the other. By this
arrangement nearly half the gas supply is
saved, and therefore very little more is wanted
for a dissolving-view apparatus than for a
single lantern.</p>

<p>Dissolving view, or biunial lanterns, as
they are generally termed, are now made in
very compact form. The two systems of
lenses, one above the other—not side by side
as of old—are fitted into one mahogany case,
lined with tin, and furnished with doors, so
that the lights can be tended when necessary.
At the back of the arrangement is placed the
dissolving-tap, which is connected by indiarubber
tubing with the lime-jets, and has two
nozzles by which the hydrogen and oxygen
respectively can be supplied to it. The dissolver
is also furnished with by-passes, so
that when the gases are turned from one
lantern, just sufficient remains to keep the
jet turned down ‘to the blue.’</p>

<p>The management of a pair of lanterns like
this is, of course, much more onerous than
that of a single lantern; but when once
understood presents no difficulty. Before
lighting up, be quite sure that all connections—and
there are many—are quite secure, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
that each place where indiarubber tubing fits
on to metal is secured with twine. Now
light the hydrogen in both lanterns, which
you can do by placing the dissolving-tap in
an upright position. Move the dissolver
until the upper jet seems on the point of
going out; but prevent it doing so by opening
the hydrogen by-pass, and adjust this
little tap so that the flame remains about one
inch high when the other lantern is being
used. Move the dissolver backwards and
forwards a few times, so as to see that it
works well, and that the hydrogen flares up
in each lantern alternately.</p>

<p>We can now pay attention to the oxygen
supply. First see that the bag is properly
adjusted between the pressure-boards, and
that the weight—one 56 lb. weight is sufficient
to begin with—is in its place, above the
upper board. Attending to the lower lantern
first, turn up the hydrogen, and very gently
admit the oxygen by turning the tap attached
to the jet. When the light has been
satisfactorily established, the oxygen by-pass
must be turned in the same way that the
other by-pass was just now treated, so as to
admit a small amount of gas passing to the
lantern not in use. If this be not done, the
sudden inrush of the oxygen is sure to cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
a small explosion, which will blow the light
out. This does not indicate any danger
whatever, but is inconvenient and undesirable
during an exhibition. The upper lantern
may now be attended to with the same precautions;
and if all has been done well, the
light will move from jet to jet alternately, as
the dissolver is worked.</p>

<p>In using a double lantern, it is necessary to
make both pictures coincident on the sheet.
If one picture overlaps the other at every
change, it has a most slovenly appearance.
Such an error can be avoided by manipulating
certain screws fitted to the metal front of the
lantern, by which the two discs thrown upon
the sheet can be adjusted until they quite
coincide. These screws allow the lower
nozzle to be pointed slightly upwards, and
the upper one to point downwards, so that
the images cast by each may be made to meet
at the screen.</p>

<p>The double lantern is mainly employed for
dissolving views; but its use does not stop
here. A great many beautiful “effects” can
be compassed by its means, a few of which I
may here describe. Statuary slides form very
beautiful pictures if photographed direct from
the marble; but their effect is much enhanced
if, by means of the auxiliary lantern, a glow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
of colour is thrown upon the screen at the
same time. A few squares of differently
tinted glasses, each mounted like an ordinary
slide, with a mask of oval or round shape, are
all that is needed. Again, a wintry scene in
one lantern may be much improved by the
effect of falling snow, produced by working a
special form of slide in the other lantern.
This slide consists merely of a frame containing
a roller at the top with the handle
projecting outside. As the handle is rotated,
a long ribbon of black paper pierced with
needle-pricks is rolled up upon it, and each
prick makes a descending spot of light upon
the screen, which together look exactly like
falling snow. Sunset and moonlight effects,
windows lighted up in night-scenes, ripples
upon water, can all be managed by specially-devised
‘effect’ slides in the second lantern.
These effects can be much extended when a
triple lantern is employed; but as this instrument
is not often found—out of the hands of
professional operators—we need not further
allude to it.</p>

<p>But the double lantern can be used with
great advantage from an educational point of
view, in a manner that was first suggested
by the present writer. I mean in the demonstration
of the main features of Spectrum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Analysis. Let me cite one example. A slide
prepared and coloured so as to represent
the continuous solar spectrum, marked with
the principal <i>Frauenhofer</i> lines, is placed, say,
in the lower lantern. We now wish to show
the bright lines given by an incandescent
metal, say <i>sodium</i>. A slide, all blackened out
but the double D line due to sodium, and so
placed on the glass that it will exactly
register with the D line in the coloured
spectrum slide, is placed in the upper lantern.
The dissolver is now brought into
play, and can be so adjusted that while the
continuous spectrum has all but faded away,
the two brilliant sodium lines stand out
boldly in their proper place. The spectra of
all the other metals can be treated in exactly
the same manner, keeping the continuous
spectrum in the lower lantern for constant
comparison and reference.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="c4">MAKING OXYGEN GAS.</h2>
</div>


<p>There is very little danger incurred in the
use of the lime-light if only the operator be
intelligent in its employment. But there are
certain dangers connected with the preliminary
making of the oxygen gas, so that that part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the work should only be entrusted to a careful
worker, and one who, knowing where
the greatest care is required, will take every
precaution against disaster. I have myself
made several thousand feet of oxygen on different
occasions, and have never yet met with
any mishap; but as I know of cases where
serious accidents have occurred, I have endeavoured
to find out why they have happened,
and I now consider myself forewarned, and
therefore forearmed, against their repetition.
The articles required for making the gas comprise
a retort in which to generate it, a gas-stove
to furnish the necessary heat, a wash-bottle
or purifier, an indiarubber gas-bag, and
several feet of tubing. Beyond these is wanted
the mixture of chlorate of potash and peroxide
of manganese in powder, which forms the charge
of the retort, from which the gas is generated
on the application of heat.</p>

<p>I have found that the best proportions of
chemicals to use are four parts (by weight) of
chlorate to one of manganese. Before being
mixed together, both should be most carefully
picked over, and most probably both will yield
a small crop of bits of straw and wood-chips,
which are not only injurious, but would in
sufficient quantity prove actually dangerous if
permitted to remain. The larger crystals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the chlorate, and any lumps which may be
found in the manganese, should be rubbed
down to powder by gentle pressure with the
wooden spoon used for mixing the compound,
about two pounds of which will yield sufficient
gas for an evening’s show. The mixture can
now be funnelled into the retort, the nozzle of
which, after being blown through to see that the
passage is clear, can be screwed into its place.</p>

<p>The purifier, or wash-bottle, is made of tin,
or may consist of a wide-mouthed bottle with
an indiarubber cap, fitted with inlet and outlet
tubes of metal or glass. In either case the
vessel is three-parts filled with water, the inlet
tube dipping some inches below the surface.
This tube is subsequently connected by three
or four feet of indiarubber tubing with the
retort. As the gas is given off, it bubbles
through this water, which not only cools it,
but catches the particles of solid matter which
are sure to be blown from the retort. The
outlet tube is connected with the gas-bag. In
the annexed illustration the relative positions
of the retort, purifier, and gas-bag are shown,
but in practice certain modifications are desirable.
It is as well, for instance, to stand
a chair between the retort and purifier, upon
which the connecting rubber tube may rest,
otherwise the water evolved from the crystals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of potash will condense in the tube and obstruct
the passage of the gas. Again, the gas-bag,
instead of being on the same level, should be
laid on a table, so that any water accidentally
driven from the purifier may not be forced
into it. The rubber tubes should have an
orifice of nearly half an inch, and should on
no account contain an inside coil of wire.
Previous to making gas the bag should be
warmed for an hour or so in front of a fire, so
as to make it soft and pliable. The cock
should then be opened, and the bag rolled
tightly up so as to expel any air. The tap
should then be closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="diagram">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Diagram showing relative positions of <i>g b</i>, Gas-bag; <i>w b</i>,<br>
Wash-bottle; and <i>r</i>, Retort.</p>
</div>

<p>When all is ready, and every junction made
except that between the bag and the pipe leading
from the purifier, the gas-stove may be
kindled, but turned down almost to its lowest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
point. If this precaution be not observed, the
oxygen will come off with such rapidity as to
be quite out of control, and will probably blow
the connections away. In two or three minutes
the gas will commence to bubble through the
purifier, at first intermittently, but the bubbling
will gradually become more regular,
until it is evident that oxygen is coming over
in earnest. The brightening of a spark at the
end of a blown-out match, held to the end of
the purifier-tube, will announce the fact that
all the air has been driven out of the pipes,
and that gas has taken its place. Now is the
time to connect the gas-bag with the purifier.
With a quick movement the indiarubber tube
should be slipped over the nozzle of the bag
with one hand, while the tap is turned on with
the other. The gas should now come over
regularly until the bag is nearly half full, and
this will occupy about fifteen minutes. The
action will then probably flag a little, when
the flame feeding the stove may be increased.
When the bag is nearly full the flame can
be raised, if occasion should require, to its
utmost.</p>

<p>Some care is requisite in finishing the operation.
When the bag is quite full and as tight
as a drum, it should be disconnected before
anything else is done. Of course at the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of taking the tube from it, the tap must be
turned. The next thing is to detach the retort
from the purifier <i>before the gas is extinguished
in the stove</i>. This is a most important point,
for if the retort were cooled by putting out the
gas first, the water might be sucked into the
retort from the purifier, and a small steam-boiler
explosion would be the result. In an
hour or so the retort will be cool enough to
handle, when the nozzle can be unscrewed and
the vessel washed out with several changes of
hot water. It can then be dried and put away
for the next occasion. The retort-nozzle and
its indiarubber tube should also be washed
out, or it may get clogged.</p>

<p>Particular care must be taken to purchase
the chlorate and manganese of some reliable
dealer. Accidents have been reported owing
to lamp-black, bone-black, etc., having been
supplied in error for the manganese, which is
a black powder much resembling them. I
find that the best plan is to buy several pounds
of each at a time, and to test a small quantity
of the mixed ingredients in a test-tube over a
spirit-flame. If the gas comes off with a slight
sparkling of the ingredients all is right; but if
there is anything approaching to an explosion,
the manganese is at fault. One accident which
I heard of was due to connecting the retort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the wrong side of the purifier; the gas had no
outlet, and the retort exploded, breaking all
the windows of the room in which it was.</p>

<p>Retorts are made either of copper or iron.
I have tried both, and much prefer the latter,
which have also the advantage of being cheaper
than the copper ones. A good retort should serve
for at least fifty charges, and even then a new
bottom can be put into it, and it will do duty
for another fifty. But no retort will last long
unless properly treated. I am quite satisfied
that the spent charge if allowed to remain has
the effect of eating into the metal; it should,
therefore, be washed out soon after use. The
thickness of a retort after much use can be
gauged by tapping it with the back of a knife
when empty.</p>

<p>The oxygen gas is most usually stored in
an indiarubber bag. These vary very much
in quality, and the cheapest kinds are to be
avoided. The rubber should be soft and pliant,
and should be covered outside with stout twill.
A good bag will almost last a lifetime if it be
only used occasionally. I have had one for
many years, which looks shabby enough with
constant use, but seems to be as gas-tight and
as efficient generally as the first day I had it.
Even then it had been in use for some months
by a friend.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Iron bottle for compressed oxygen gas.</p>
</div>

<p>A bag full of gas is not the most portable
thing that could be named, and various attempts
have been made to replace it by some
contrivance of a more convenient character.
There is, too, the danger of accidental injury,
which can readily occur if the bag is carelessly
handled. In very cold weather, for example,
some bags get quite stiff and hard,
and have to be almost thawed before they can
be used. Neglect of this precaution will lead
to cracks, which will eventually turn into
holes. Metal gas-holders—miniature copies
of the big reservoirs seen at gas-works—which
serve as travelling-boxes for the rest of the
apparatus—are recommended by some, but are
seldom used. Perhaps the most convenient
arrangement—which, however, is only suitable
for a single lantern—is to employ an iron
bottle in which the oxygen is greatly compressed.
Such a bottle charged with gas can
be obtained from several dealers, and I have
had some little experience of their use. A
bottle measuring three feet in length, and about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
seven inches in diameter, will hold about eight
feet of compressed gas—sufficient for an ordinary
evening’s work. At the end of the
bottle is an opening closed with a tap which
can only be opened by a special form of key.
Into this orifice is screwed a nozzle, upon
which an indiarubber tube can be readily
fitted. When a bottle of this kind is used,
the amount of oxygen which reaches the lime
must be directly controlled by this tap, and
not by the tap attached to the jet, which must
remain fully opened. The reason of this is
that the gas issues with such force, that,
unless controlled in the way I have stated, it
will blow off the tubing by its pressure. I
found it so difficult to regulate the supply,
that I had an independent screw-tap made to
fit on to the bottle. This screw-tap is of the
same pattern as those used on steam engines
to control the supply of steam to the cylinder,
and with it I can adjust the oxygen supply
with the greatest nicety. My chief objections
to the bottle system—which presents many
advantages in the matter of portability—are,
firstly, that you cannot charge the bottle yourself—it
must always go back to the dealer for
that purpose—and you are therefore dependent
for one of your first requisites upon others;
and secondly, you do not know how much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
gas you are using, for you cannot see it
diminish as you can when you employ a bag.
For these and other reasons I still prefer bags
to store my gas, and shall continue to do so
until some improvement comes about.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="gas-bag">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Gas-bag and pressure-boards.</p>
</div>

<p>The gas-bag is wedge-shaped, and the thin
edge of the wedge has in its centre a gas-cock
for the entrance and exit of the gas. The
object of the bag being in this form is, that it
can conveniently be placed between the pressure-boards.
These, in their simplest form,
consist of two boards strongly put together—the
size of the bag which is used—which
are hinged together at one end. At the centre
of this end, and between the hinges, is cut an
oval opening through which the gas-cock is
thrust. A shelf on the upper board serves as
a support for the weights. At least two
weights are required—one being sufficient at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
first, when the bag is full; the other being
added later on when the pressure becomes
reduced. The weighted gas-bag should always
be placed as near the lantern as circumstances
will allow—in order that it may be under the
eye of the operator—and the tube from it
which supplies the lantern should be guarded,
so that it is not accidentally stepped upon.</p>

<p>The lime-cylinders are sold in air-tight tin
canisters holding one dozen each. They are
of two qualities—hard and soft. For work
where large pictures are required—necessitating
the use of the mixed jet with both gases
under heavy pressure—the hard limes must
invariably be used. But where only a small
sheet has to be covered, and one gas only is
subjected to the unusual pressure, the soft
limes will afford perhaps a better light than
the harder ones. Occasionally the lime, be
it hard or soft, will split. In such a case it
ought to be immediately replaced by a fresh
one, otherwise the flame may possibly be
diverted towards the condensing lenses, and
will fracture that nearest to the light. It is advisable
always to keep a spare lime within the
lantern, lying on the tray to which the jet is
attached. By this means it gets warmed, and
ready for use if required. Lime is most absorbent
of moisture, and will, if kept where air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
can get to it, swell to double its former size,
and finally crumble to powder. For this
reason the tin canister containing the cylinders
should have stretched over it, when once
opened, a broad indiarubber band which will
cover the junction between lid and box. If
this precaution be neglected, the limes will
swell with a force sufficient to break the tin-containing
vessel asunder. A compressed lime
cartridge, to which water is applied by artificial
means, has lately been successfully introduced
to supersede explosives hitherto used
for mining purposes. This will show the
immense power of expansion of which the
substance is capable.</p>


<hr class="full x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">THE SCREEN OR SHEET.</h2>
</div>


<p>And now a word about the best form of
screen or sheet for showing lantern pictures
upon. The best possible form of surface is a
smooth whitewashed wall; but as this is not
commonly found among the appointments of
a sitting-room, where the lantern will be
wanted, we must find some substitute which
will most nearly resemble it. A sheet of
cartoon paper, which can be bought of any
length, and measuring more than four feet
across, will do well if only a small disc is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
desired. The paper can be rolled up out of
the way at a minute’s notice. If a larger
screen is wanted, it can be made of stout
calico, faced with white paper, and can be
made to roll up and down like a school map
of large dimensions. A map-mounter, or
even an upholsterer, would soon rig up such
an arrangement.</p>

<p>There is a very effective way of showing
small pictures and diagrams with an oil-lantern,
which I have more than once adopted,
where a room has been long in proportion to
its breadth. This is to make a wooden frame
just large enough to take the full width of a
sheet of tracing-paper, and to put this screen
between the lantern and the spectators.
Tracing-<i>cloth</i> should be avoided, as it is so
transparent that the light streaming from the
lens makes a blotch in each picture when seen
through it.</p>

<p>If the lantern is brought into regular use—in
a schoolroom, for instance—it might be
thought worth while to have a canvas sheet
whitewashed, and hung in the same manner
that a stage drop-scene is fixed. In making
such a screen, the canvas should be tacked on
a frame, and should have a coating of thin
glue, which should be allowed to dry before
two or more coats of whitewash are applied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
It will be understood that a really opaque
screen, such as this represents, is the more
effective, because the light, instead of being
partly lost—as it must be in penetrating an
ordinary calico sheet—is reflected and utilized.</p>

<p>But for public exhibitions on a large scale,
the calico sheet is the screen commonly in
vogue, for it is conveniently put up and taken
down, and can be rolled into a bundle for
easy transport. A sheet properly hung should
be as flat as a board and perfectly free from
wrinkles of any kind, and this can be accomplished
without much difficulty by adopting
the following method, which is applicable to
screens from twelve feet square upwards.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="sheet">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Showing method of hanging a sheet.</p>
</div>

<p>The sheet should have at its top edge a
strong cord sewn into its hem, which cord
should terminate at each side with a loop.
On its sides and bottom edges, the sheet
should have brass curtain rings sewn on to it
at intervals of two feet. Having chosen the
position of the screen, a couple of screw-eyes
are screwed into the roof, or cornice near the
top of the hall, at such a distance apart that
the sheet can easily go between them.
Through each of these screw-eyes is passed a
thin, strong line, having at its end a clip like
that commonly attached to a dog’s chain.
This clip is to clutch the loop of rope on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
side of the sheet. The sheet can now be
pulled up into position: the free ends of the
cord being fastened to screw-eyes in the floor.
It now merely remains to lace with string the
curtain rings on the side of the sheet to the
adjacent cord, and the arrangement is complete.
The annexed diagram shows the upper
corner of such a sheet, with its attachments,
as just explained. Where the hall is of such
a height that this plan is not available, or
where the stern custodians faint with horror
at the thought of their walls or ceilings being
pierced with a screw-hole, the same method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
can be carried out by fastening the screw-eye
to a timber upright on each side, supported
by light struts.</p>

<p>Some persons prefer a sheet stretched on a
frame, and such a frame of a very portable
character can be easily devised. The frame
itself is best made of lengths of pine, about
the size of broom-handles. These can be
joined together so as to make a frame of any
reasonable dimensions, by six-inch lengths of
brass tubing. The same tubing, mitred into
L-pieces, will serve for the four corners. The
sheet is furnished with tapes to secure it to
the frame, and the woodwork is kept in an
upright position by strong cords fastened by
screw-eyes to the floor. The appearance of
such a screen is much enhanced if the plain
woodwork be hidden by a little drapery in the
shape of narrow curtains at each side, and
festoons of the same material above.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c6">PICTURES FOR THE LANTERN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Before the advent of the art of photography,
pictures or slides for the lantern were traced
on glass and painted by hand; and this art
was carried to very great perfection. But no
handiwork can equal the productions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
photographic camera; so that when it was
found possible to produce transparent positives
on glass, that could be magnified on the sheet
to any extent without deterioration, the occupation
of the artist on glass was almost gone.
Photographs are now almost exclusively used,
and form, when properly executed, the finest
pictures for lantern use. The manner of their
production is fully described in my little book
‘How to Photograph;’ but as there may be
many would-be lanternists who do not care to
dabble in photography, I will here give a few
plain directions by which lantern slides can be
extemporised.</p>

<p>The standard size for lantern pictures is
3¼ × 3¼ inches. The glass chosen should be
as thin as possible, and quite free from
scratches, bubbles, or flaws of any kind whatever.
Remember that a piece of the finest hair
which may well be overlooked upon the slide
itself, will appear on the screen as a huge snake.
In like manner a tiny bubble in the glass is
magnified into a blemish the size of a soup-plate.
Glass presents a very difficult surface
to draw or paint upon, particularly if water-colours
are employed, but by coating it with
a transparent medium in the first instance the
difficulty is much reduced. A film of plain
collodion will, when dry, give a surface that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
can be easily sketched upon with a fine pen
and Indian ink. The sketch so made can afterwards
be filled in with water-colour, tempered
with prepared ox-gall, and taking care that the
colours used are those which are naturally
transparent. Prussian blue, indigo, lake, the
madders, gamboge, burnt and raw Sienna,
Vandyke brown, are all transparent pigments,
and will answer every purpose. Mixed with
one another in the manner detailed in any
manual of water-colour painting, greens,
purples, and all secondary and tertiary tints
are readily obtainable.</p>

<p>Another method, and an easier one, for producing
lantern slides was introduced some
years ago by the Rev. W. H. Dallinger; and
although the author of the method intended
it for drawings of microscopic subjects only,
and with that idea brought it before the notice
of the Royal Microscopical Society, it will be
readily seen that it is adapted to all manner
of lantern pictures. This method is best described
in its inventor’s own words: ‘On
finely ground glass drawing with a black-lead
pencil is as easy as drawing upon cardboard.
I get squares of glass to suit the size of my
lantern carefully ground on one side like the
focusing-glass of a camera.’ The author
goes on to describe how, by sketching upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the finely ground surface with a well-pointed
hard pencil—HH or HHH—and
shading with a softer one, such as HB, capital
effects can be obtained. ‘If it be necessary to
put in colour it may be done, cleanly and
carefully over the shading; thus one layer of
colour suffices. Now, of course, although we
have a perfect drawing of the object, with all
the detail accurately given, it is not a transparency.
But we can easily make it one.
Thin some good pale Canada balsam with
benzine to about the consistency of cream, and
simply float it over the ground surface of your
glass; pour off until the drop comes very
sluggishly. Then reverse the glass so that
the corner from which the balsam was flowing
off be placed upwards. Let the return flow
reach about the middle; then reverse it again,
and move it in several directions to get the
balsam level. This may be done with a very
little practice, so that the surface shall be undistinguishable
from glass. We have now a
perfect transparency. All that is required is
twenty-four hours for hardening (keeping the
glass level), and then another square of glass
fastened on to it by strips of paper at the
edges, with small pieces of card at the corners
to prevent contact, and it makes an admirable
lantern transparency.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>A hint about giving a fine grain to glass
will not be out of place. Upon a perfectly flat
and firm table lay a piece of glass say six and
a half inches square, for this size can afterwards
be cut across into four lantern pictures.
A sheet of wet blotting-paper under the glass
will keep it steady. Now pour upon its surface
a mixture of flour-emery and water. Place
another piece of glass above, and work it
round with a circular motion, constantly spooning
up the mud formed by the emery and
water, and which oozes out between the glasses,
and replacing it between them. In a short
time both glasses will be beautifully ground
on the surfaces which have been rubbed together.
A moment’s consideration will show
that the ground effect is produced by the surface
being broken up into innumerable tiny
pits, each one of which scatters the light. By
Mr. Dallinger’s method of filling up these pits
with a glassy medium like Canada balsam,
the glass is once more presented with a flat
surface, and therefore becomes once more
transparent.</p>

<p>By whatever means the picture is produced
the operator should have a glass transparent
easel to work upon placed at an angle of forty-five
degrees, with a sheet of paper underneath
it to throw the light up through the glass he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
is drawing upon. A good easel can be made
of a small frame—that belonging to a twopenny
slate will do—attached to a base-board, and
supported on each side by struts. A ledge of
wood screwed across the frame makes a convenient
support for the picture. The annexed
cut will sufficiently explain the arrangements
described.</p>

<img src="images/fig7.jpg" alt="easel">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Glass easel.</p>
</div>


<p>And now a word or two about mounting the
picture. As Mr. Dallinger points out, a cover-glass
should be provided, but it should be prevented
from actually touching the painted
surface. This is best brought about by using
the masks cut out of black paper, and sold
for the purpose. A mask is inserted between
the glasses, after which the whole is fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
together by pasting a slip of paper round
the edges of the double glass, and turning
it over on either side. Gum arabic with
twenty-five per cent. loaf-sugar added, is a
good medium by which to attach paper to
glass.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">ON THE COLOURING OF PHOTOGRAPHIC<br>
TRANSPARENCIES.</h2>
</div>


<p>There are many amateur photographers
nowadays who can produce fair transparencies
for the lantern, but at the same time there are
many possessors of a lantern who know nothing
about the ‘black art.’ Luckily for these, first-class
pictures can be bought cheaply, their
average price ranging from eighteenpence to
two shillings each. Any optician’s catalogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
will show what an immense variety of subjects
there is to chose from; not only can we obtain
landscapes of nearly every part of the world,
but we can purchase figure studies, copies of
various pictures from books, maps, diagrams
of scientific matters—micro-photographs and
statuary. These slides if coloured are double
the price of plain ones, and if very well
coloured their price is quadrupled.</p>

<p>It would therefore be serviceable to many if
they could learn how to colour such pictures
for their own use, and I give simple directions
how this can be accomplished. At the
same time it is only fair to state that the work
is really difficult, and anyone to attain even
slight proficiency in slide-painting must devote
a great deal of time and patience to the subject.</p>

<p>The photographic slide as sold consists of
two glasses, one of which bears the photograph.
This is separated from the cover-glass by a
paper mask, the whole being bound round by
a fillet of gummed paper. After carefully cutting
round this fillet the two glasses may be
separated, and the one bearing the picture is
placed, varnished side upwards, upon the glass
easel, ready for colouring. Some colourists
speak in favour of water-colours for glass-painting,
others prefer oil-colours, while some,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
I understand, employ both on the same
picture. I have tried each system, and most
certainly recommend oil-colours as being both
easier to work with, and doing more satisfactory
work into the bargain than water-colours.</p>

<p>The materials required comprise ordinary
oil-colours in tubes, of which the following are
perhaps the most useful that can be employed
for the purpose:</p>

<table>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Italian Pink.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Prussian Blue.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Rose Madder.</td></tr>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Raw Sienna.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Indigo.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Purple Madder.</td></tr>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Yellow Lake.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Neutral Tint.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Crimson Lake.</td></tr>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Chinese Orange. &#160;</td>
  <td class="tdl">McGilp.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Burnt Sienna.</td></tr>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Brown Pink.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Brown Madder. &#160;</td>
  <td class="tdl">Ivory Black.</td></tr>



</table>


<p>It is curious to observe that the suitability
of these colours for the particular purpose of
glass-painting varies with the method of manufacture.
I find by experience that one maker’s
Prussian blue is better than another’s, while
for a suitable crimson lake I have to go to
quite a different shop, and so on.</p>

<p>The brushes used must be of the best, the
majority of them being camel-hair, a few
fine sables being kept for special touches. It
is also necessary to provide some good large
bushy camel-hair brushes to be used as softeners.</p>

<p>A flat porcelain palette is better than one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
any other material, for the strength of the
tints is seen well, and the surface can easily be
cleaned with a little turpentine. A flexible
palette knife must also be provided.</p>

<p>Dabbers to soften down skies and other flat
masses of colour can be made by wrapping a
ball of cotton wool in fine wash-leather. The
leather should be first thoroughly washed with
soap and water, and it will be better if a little
of the soap be left in it as it dries, for this
renders it soft and pliant. Both dabbers and
brushes should be kept in a dust-tight box,
for dust is the greatest enemy of the slide-painter.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the list of colours
given includes those only which are transparent,
many others used in ordinary oil-painting
being omitted. It is obvious that opaque
colours like Naples yellow or chrome yellow
would simply appear black on the sheet. The
tyro who is used to other methods of painting,
and has some idea of the harmony of colours,
will, of course, have an immense advantage
over anyone without artistic knowledge or feeling;
and when he has once mastered the technicalities
of the new work, will soon be able to
produce passable pictures. The list of colours
given is necessarily limited for the reason
already given, but their number can be increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
indefinitely by judicious blending
one with the other. Let me give a few instances.</p>

<p>There is no green in the list given, simply
because I do not know of a good transparent
one. But various tints of green suitable for
foliage can be easily made up with the colours
named. Prussian blue mixed with any of the
yellows will at once give a crude green, but it
will not be suitable for use without the help of
some other tint, such as burnt Sienna, or one
of the reds. Italian pink and indigo make a
fine green. Italian pink, brown madder, and
Prussian blue is also another useful combination.
Brown pink, indigo, and Vandyke
brown will be found admirable for the
shadows in foliage; indeed, the combinations
for this purpose are endless. Again, there is a
difficulty generally found in obtaining any
approach to scarlet. The best I know of
is a mixture of Italian pink, crimson lake,
and Chinese orange. For browns, Vandyke
brown, Chinese orange, ivory black, and
burnt Sienna, will give any range of tints,
from the coldest to the warmest. The reader
will soon find by experiment the right proportions
for mixing these colours to produce the
desired effect, and he will be much assisted in
the work by studying any good manual of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
water-colour painting. I recommend a water-colour
manual in preference to one dealing with
oil-colours, because the first deals more with
transparent tints, which depend for their
effect upon the white ground upon which they
are laid. In like manner a lantern picture
depends much upon the white surface upon
which the tints are subsequently exhibited.</p>

<p>Our first attempt at glass-painting shall be
an open landscape with figures in front—and
we will suppose that the scene is laid in
Britain. This would seem to some an unimportant
point, until they remember that the
skies and atmospheric effects seen in some
other lands would require an altogether
different treatment. I once coloured an
Egyptian scene for a friend, and he admired
my work, with one exception. ‘You have
given me an English sky,’ he said. The sky
will be the first thing to see to, and we will
endeavour to give it a flat tint of blue slightly
darker at the zenith than it is at the horizon.
We squeeze out from its tube a little Prussian
blue upon the palette, and dipping a good-sized
camel-hair brush into a small cup of
turpentine, we take up a little of the colour
and work it about on the palette until it seems
of the right strength. Before applying it to
the glass we add to it a very small quantity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
McGilp medium. Having mixed this last
addition with our brush-load of colour, we can
apply it to the glass, painting it in broad
bands from side to side until the sky is all
striped with blue. If the subject comprises
a range of distant hills, let them too partake
of the blue tint. When this is done, lay aside
the brush and let the coloured glass rest for a
minute, so that some of the turpentine will
dry off. Now proceed to dab it carefully with
one of the leather dabbers. With a very light
touch bring the dabber down over and over
again, and avoid anything like a rubbing
action. The movement must be vertical, and
not in the least horizontal. By bearing a little
more heavily on the dabber as the horizon
is approached, the tint will be sensibly
lightened.</p>

<p>When this sky-colour has been uniformly
dabbed in we may proceed to put in, or rather
wipe out, some cloud effects. A little piece of
soft kid wrapped round a pointed pen-holder
is a good tool to use for the purpose, but a
leather stump will answer the same end. This
part of the work requires a little judgment
and artistic taste. In a picture full of detail
and which only has a small portion of sky
exposed, it is best coloured simply blue. But
where there is not much detail in the landscape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
as in the case for instance of a mill on a bleak
moor, the sky can be worked up with great
advantage to the general effect. The clouds
are wiped out by a rubbing action combined
with a dabbing movement, so that the edges
of the clouds formed remain quite soft. If
they appear too hard they can be corrected by
a few gentle dabs with the top of the finger.
Before the leather is laid aside, it may be employed
for wiping off any portions of colour
which have accidentally been placed where
they should not be. But if there is water included
in the subject, such as a lake or river,
it will when the sky is reflected in it partake
of the same colour, and should be dabbed in
at the same time.</p>

<p>We must now consider how we are going
to treat the rest of our picture. If there is
some expanse of foreground it will make the
best contrast with the sky if we use a warm
sandy colour. Chinese orange, raw Sienna, and
brown pink mixed in various proportions to
suit the lights and shadows of the picture will
give the tint required. At this stage, too, the
middle tints of the composition lying between
the sky and the foreground can also be laid in.
These will mostly consist of subdued greys,
made up of Prussian blue, burnt Sienna,
purple madder, and crimson lake. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
these tints are all dabbed in, and the whole
picture has been carefully gone over with the
leather point, so as to remove truant colour,
the slide may be laid aside to dry. I find it
a good plan to have a tin box containing
grooves for this purpose. The slides when
grounded in in the way just described are
placed in the grooves, and the open box is
turned towards a fire. In an hour or so the
colours are dry enough for further treatment.</p>

<p>We can now once more view our work on
the easel, and most probably we shall see much
to amend. The trees in the middle distance
are too yellow, or too blue. They are easily
corrected by a touch of the tint in which they
fail. But at this stage of the painting we
must use a different medium for our colours.
We have done with dabbing, and must now
lay the colours on as smoothly as possible
with the brush alone. Canada balsam in
turpentine, of the consistence of very thin
varnish, is perhaps the best medium to use.
It should be mixed with every colour as it is
taken upon the brush.</p>

<p>The beginner will find some difficulty at
first, particularly if oil-colours are new to him,
in keeping his brushes in order. He need not
have a brush for every tint. Let one be kept
for skies, but only two or three others are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
necessary. When I commence to paint a batch
of pictures I put on my table, after carefully
dusting it all over with a damp cloth, a sheet
of newspaper. In the centre stands my easel.
On the left hand my colour-box, and on the
right my palette. Close to the palette is
placed a double thickness of clean white tissue
paper, and a small pot of turpentine. When
I wish to clean my brush, it is simply dipped
in turpentine, and drawn over the surface of
the white paper until I see that it leaves no
trail of colour. By this simple means one
brush can be used for any number of tints,
for the cleansing of it does not occupy more
than ten seconds.</p>

<p>It is in the foreground of a picture that the
artist must be lavish with his bright colours.
If the figures in the subject will allow of
bright colouring, so much the better; but it
must be remembered that if these colours are
not put in with some regard to contrast, their
effect is much diminished, if not altogether
lost. Let the painter remember that the
principal colours have their complementary
colours, and that wherever we can place one
of these tints against its complementary, we
are bound to have harmony. Thus the complementary
of blue is orange; of red, green;
and of yellow, purple. But for further particulars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of this nature, the aforesaid ‘Manual
of Water-Colours’ must be studied.</p>

<p>When the picture is apparently finished, it
will, most likely, require some finishing-touches.
And here a new tool comes into
use, namely, the etching-needle. Take a
pointed piece of wood, about the size of a
penholder, and bind upon it, by means of
waxed thread, a good strong sewing-needle,
leaving not more than a quarter of an inch
of the point exposed. A few judicious touches
with this needle will make a vast difference
in the effect of a picture, but anything like
coarse scratching must be avoided. The
beginner will do well to view his work in
the lantern as it gradually progresses, for
what may look very well on the easel, will look
very different when all its imperfections are
magnified on the screen. The art of slide-painting
is one which requires constant care
and practice before anything like proficiency
is attained.</p>

<p>In case some of my readers should be well
acquainted with the use of water-colours, and
may be deterred from trying the art of glass-painting
because oils only are recommended
for the work, I will briefly describe how
water-colours are utilized for slide-painting.
At the same time, I hold to my previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
expressed opinion, that oil-colours are the
more suitable pigments to use.</p>

<p>The varnished surface of a glass picture
does not take kindly to water-colour, and as
the brush is applied to it there is a repellent
action which would make the painter despair
if some means were not at hand to obviate the
difficulty. By mixing each colour with a
certain proportion of prepared ox-gall the
difficulty vanishes, and it is a wise precaution
to rub a little ox-gall and water over the
surface of the picture by means of a tuft of
cotton wool, before any colour is applied at
all.</p>

<p>The same transparent colours as those recommended
for oil-painting may be employed,
besides a few more transparent tints which
are commonly not ground up in oil. But the
dabbers are of a different description. Procure
two or three good thick camel-hair
brushes, and cut the hair off straight with a
pair of scissors, so as to leave the ends of the
hairs like a flat stump. Now carefully turn
the brush round and round in the flame of a
spirit lamp, or candle, so as to just singe the
point of each hair. When this is done, rub
the ends of the hair on the finest glass-paper
until every trace of singeing has disappeared.
This treatment will leave the brush with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
flat woolly head like a mop, which makes an
excellent dabber.</p>

<p>When the sky-colour has been applied as
evenly as possible, and has been allowed to
dry, the surface may be worked over with the
dabber. But, before doing this, gently breathe
over the colour. The dabber will remove
little particles of the pigment, and will reduce
the general strength of the tint, so that this
loss should be provided for when the colour
is first applied. Clouds, etc., can be wiped
out with the leather, after the breathing
operation, and in many other respects the two
modes of colouring agree.</p>

<p>When the general tints have been laid in,
the colours may receive a coat of mastic
varnish, and this again can be worked over
with colour to strengthen those tints which
may require it. The varnish also confers a
transparency upon the tints that they do not
possess without it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c8">SHOWING SOLID &amp; OPAQUE OBJECTS<br>
ON THE LANTERN SCREEN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Those who are familiar with the working of
the microscope know that the objects which
are employed in that instrument can be viewed
in two different ways. Transparent preparations
have the light thrown through them by
means of the adjustable mirror beneath the
stage. Opaque objects, on the other hand,
must have light thrown upon them from
above, and this is managed by means of a
separate condensing lens. For the magic
lantern, transparent pictures are almost wholly
employed; but there is a means of utilizing
paper prints, photographic <i>cartes de visite</i>, and
a certain limited number of solid objects, so
that they may be shown in an enlarged form
on the sheet. The effect is not so bright as
when transparencies are employed, for a large
proportion of the available light is absorbed
in the operation; but there are many who
would sacrifice a good deal in the way of
effect, for the undoubted advantage of being
able to utilize the contents of their albums, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>The first instrument which was constructed
to accomplish this end is known as Chadburn’s
lantern; and, as will be seen from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>annexed diagram, it differs very much from
the ordinary form of magic lantern. From
what has been already said concerning the
loss of light, it will be evident that a powerful
luminant is a matter of prime consideration.
A good oil-lantern will do the work—but
not so well as the lime-jet. The luminous
face of the lime, instead of being turned towards
the optical system, is opposite a concave
reflector placed at the back of the lantern.
From this the light is reflected towards the
condenser, which condenser concentrates the
light obliquely upon the object. The picture
or object is contained in a kind of box joined
to the main lantern, and which holds immediately
opposite the illuminated picture the
lens for projecting its image upon the screen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
This pioneer form of opaque lantern has been
superseded by the instrument called the
Aphengescope. This can be purchased now
of most opticians. Virtually it consists of the
front chamber of Chadburn’s lantern constructed
to fit on to the front of any ordinary
oil or lime-lit lantern.</p>

<p>The aphengescope can be used for showing
woodcuts, paper photographs, printed
and written matter of any kind, so long as
the space covered is within the size of the
instrument. Thus any caricatures from our
comic publications could be pasted on card,
and enlarged by its means. But it will be
readily observed that this class of subjects, if
photographed as transparent positives and
used in the ordinary lantern, can be shown
far better. The principal use of the aphengescope
is to show solid objects which cannot
by any possibility be shown enlarged without
its help.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for instance, that it is desired
by some collector to show his friends a
cabinet of coins and medals. Such objects
are so bright in themselves that they are
admirably adapted to this instrument. Their
form, colour, and minute markings are faithfully
reproduced; whilst the raised portions
catch the reflected light in such a way as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
make the images look as solid as the objects
themselves. At the Polytechnic Institution,
a lecture upon the invention of the watch, and
its gradual development, was beautifully illustrated
by the opaque lantern. First came
the different parts of the watch, and then the
varied movements. It was most curious and
instructive to see the wheels and springs all
in movement upon the screen.</p>

<p>There are also many natural things which
can be shown by the same means. A freshly
opened oyster makes a very remarkable object.
A still more curious effect is obtained by
concentrating the light upon a freshly cut
orange or lemon. When the fruit is squeezed,
the pips and juice appear to fly upwards; for,
of course, everything is shown upside down,
as in the ordinary lantern. The opaque lantern
was once introduced into a court of law
in America, as a witness for the prosecution
in a case of forgery. The following is a condensed
account of the occurrence, taken from a
New York paper:</p>

<p>‘During the recent trial, it became necessary
to show the differences between a genuine
signature and an imitation or forgery of the
same. For this purpose, there was brought
into court a powerful reflecting magic lantern.
The room was darkened, and images of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
two signatures, enormously magnified, were
thrown side by side upon a screen before the
judge and jury. The false signature was at
once revealed. The illumination of the writing
was effected by means of two powerful lime-lights
contained within the lantern. The
peculiar arrangement of the lights and screen
enables the examiner to discover the surface
of the paper through the ink, so that patching,
shading, or painting of letters becomes evident
the instant it is brought under the focus of the
lantern. An arrangement of screens, by which
the light is cut off alternately from either side
of the instrument, discovers any tampering
with the surface of the paper, either by scratching
or washing by chemicals. (In other words,
by throwing the light alternately from either
side, the relief caused by the grain of the
paper is clearly shown; and any tampering
with that relief, by scratching or otherwise, at
once becomes apparent.) The instrument, in
this case, was of sufficient capacity to view at
once two bank-notes placed side by side, and
the pictures were of such fineness that there
was no difficulty in viewing their smallest
details. I fear that the introduction of a magic
lantern into an English court of law would be
rather too sensational for the ordinary legal
mind—particularly as the evidence of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
expert, with the help of a microscope, would
answer the same end.</p>

<p>Under the name of the Physioscope, an
immense opaque lantern was exhibited some
years back in London. The object magnified
on the sheet was the human face, and a correcting
lens was included in the apparatus, so
that the face was seen right way up. It was
always rather an unhappy face, for the individual
who lent his countenance to the transaction
had on either side of him, and within
a few inches of his cheeks, a very powerful
lime-light, the heat and glare from which
were sufficient to render anyone uncomfortable
who was not a salamander.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c9">THE LANTERN MICROSCOPE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Of late years it has become possible to take
very beautiful photographs of microscopic
objects, which, when used as lantern-slides,
give a very fine effect. Numerous slides of
this character may now be purchased, which
cover a vast field of microscopic knowledge,
and many will be content with what they can
thus obtain. But there is another class of
workers who, perhaps possessing a large
number of microscopic slides, will be glad to
utilize them for the lantern, so that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
no longer limited to the individual eye. For
these the lantern microscope, which will screw
in front of the lantern in place of the
usual optical system, is a most useful instrument.
Different makers advertise in their
catalogues lantern microscopes which range in
price from twenty-five shillings to as many
guineas. And it recently came to my knowledge
that a well-known London optician has
undertaken the construction of a few of these
instruments at the price of £150 each. The
amateur lanternist will, therefore, have some
difficulty in deciding what he ought to pay
for such an instrument. And it is most
difficult to advise him on that point. His
best plan is, perhaps, to see for himself what
the makers can offer him, and, if possible, to
seek a trial of the instrument before he purchases
it.</p>

<p>The lantern microscope is a modification of
the old solar microscope—an instrument
which could be screwed against a hole in the
shutter of a darkened room—and which had
a mirror outside which projected a beam of
sunlight through it. The objective lenses
were uncorrected, and small in aperture, so
that the instrument was far from being a
perfect one. But the intensity of the solar
light covered many objectionable features, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
it was possible to get some astonishing effects
with the contrivance. But sunlight is such
an uncertain commodity in our climate that,
when the lime-light came into prominence,
the old solar microscope was forgotten in
favour of that which depended upon a more
constant, if a far less intense, light source.</p>

<p>The great difficulty to overcome in the
lantern microscope is to get the light sufficiently
intense to well illuminate the objects.
The aperture of a microscope objective, even
of low power, is so small, that, when the
pencil of light which it emits is spread over a
screen, the light is so attenuated that the
details of the object are difficult to make out.
In the near future, when we are promised that
electricity shall be laid on to our homes, as
gas is now supplied to us, the difficulty will
disappear, for the electric-arc light is many
times more intense than the most powerful
lime-jet.</p>

<p>Having obtained a lantern microscope, the
next thing to consider is the class of objects
which can best be shown with it. To help
the reader in determining this point, I will
now give a kind of sketch of a popular lecture
to accompany an exhibition of the instrument.</p>

<p>Such a lecture might usefully commence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
with a brief description of the microscope:
its history, and how, in its improved form,
it has opened up a world of minute life, of
which our forefathers could have had no conception.
We might then put forward a few
remarks as to the adaptation of the microscope
to the oxyhydrogen lantern, and point
out how by its aid a number of persons can at
the same time see what, in an ordinary microscope,
is visible to only one person. So much
by way of introduction.</p>

<p>We might next enlarge upon the circumstance
that the contents of the world have
been classified into three general divisions—popularly
known as the three kingdoms of
Nature: the Mineral Kingdom, the Vegetable
Kingdom, and the Animal Kingdom.
Show how one is dependent upon the other,
and the difficulty in many cases of drawing a
line to separate the minute organisms of the
Animal Kingdom from those of the Vegetable
World. Numerous examples from the lower
forms of life may be quoted to illustrate
this. Now show and explain subjects from
each of the three divisions, taking the
minerals first. Define a mineral, and show
how they crystallize in definite forms. Illustrate
the process of crystallization by putting
a drop of a saturated solution of sal-ammoniac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
on a slip of glass, and spreading it over with
a brush. Such a glass placed in the microscope
will, as it dries, become covered with
branches of crystals, which seem to grow
and strike out in various directions on the
sheet in a truly marvellous manner. Sections
of various minerals may next be shown,
finishing with sections of coal. In pointing
out the origin of coal from plants, we may
easily drift into the next division of our
subject—the Vegetable Kingdom.</p>

<p>Here we have indeed a wide field to illustrate.
Commencing from the simple cell, as
exhibited, for instance, in a bit of so-called
green mould, and arriving gradually at sections
of different stems of plants (which by
the way form most beautiful objects on the
screen), sections of different woods, parts of
flowers, etc. From these it will be easy to
step over the indistinct boundary-line which
separates us from the Animal World. Here
we can commence with the lowest organisms;
next show the living inhabitants of our ponds
and ditches. Arrive at the Insect World, and
show the generally unfamiliar parts of familiar
insects—bees, wasps, flies, etc. We can then
go higher, and exhibit sections of bone, hair,
etc.; finishing with the structure of the
human body, so far as it can be indicated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
means of the microscope. This is a brief
sketch of the kind of entertainment the
microscope is able to afford, which can be
modified to suit the views of the exhibitor.</p>


<hr class="full x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="c10">MECHANICAL OR MOVING-PICTURES.</h2>
</div>


<p>The most common form of moveable slide
is that known as a ‘comic slip.’ This mechanical
contrivance for the amusement of
youth is generally of the coarsest execution,
and it speaks little for the originality of our
slide-producers that the same old things should
appear in catalogues year after year with no
improvement. The ‘comic slip’ consists of a
glass in a wooden frame, with another loose
piece of glass which can work backwards and
forwards in front of it. This movable glass
generally serves as a mere screen to cover
something painted underneath it, and it is
rubbed over with black varnish so as to be
opaque. Thus a gentleman is represented
with a nose of the normal size, but as the
screen is withdrawn it elongates to an awful
extent. Or a woman’s tongue may be graphically,
if not elegantly, portrayed in the same
manner.</p>

<p>In another class of slide a circular glass is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
kept in slow rotation in front of the slide
proper by means of a rack-work attachment.
A common design for this device is a landscape
with a windmill in the centre. The
sails of the mill are painted on the revolving
glass, and can be kept in rotation as long as
desired. The chromatrope effect is managed
in the same way, only that in this case both
glasses are caused to slowly revolve in reverse
directions. There are many people who
admire chromatropes, and many others who
regard them as rather trying to the eyes.
Rippling water, the rising or setting of the
sun or moon, and astronomical slides illustrative
of the movements of the heavenly
bodies, are among the subjects which can
be well illustrated by mechanical means.</p>

<p>Perhaps the cleverest piece of apparatus
ever invented to give the effect of movement
by means of a magic lantern is Beale’s choreutoscope.
This instrument depends upon the
well-known phenomenon common to our eyes,
called persistence of vision. The image of
anything that we look at is cast upon the
retina at the back of the eye by the agency
of the crystalline lens, which is placed behind
the pupil. So far, the human eye resembles
a camera obscura. Persistence of vision means
that an image so cast upon the retina remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
impressed there for about the eighth part of a
second. For this reason we wink continually
without knowing it, for the light impression
remains with us during the short time that
the eye is closed in accomplishing that necessary
action. A burnt stick with a red-hot
end whirled round and round appears to us
like an unbroken circle of fire. The separate
drops of rain as they fall from the sky look
like streaks of water, and so an artist will
represent them in his picture. A quickly
moving meteor looks like a long trail of fire
for the same reason.</p>

<p>In the choreutoscope we have a very elegant
adaptation of the same principle. It consists,
in its commercial form, of a slide arrangement
that can be placed in any lantern. This contains
a narrow strip of glass, with, say, six
figures painted upon it, each figure having a
different position. A dancing man is a good
representative of the rest. By a turn of a
handle each figure is brought into view successively,
but so rapidly as to give the effect
of moving arms and legs. An interceptor or
screen runs in front of each figure as the change
occurs.</p>

<p>One of the best designs made for this instrument
is a dancing skeleton (see annexed cut).
In this case the figures are cut stencil-fashion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
out of very thin brass, and the openings thus
cut transmit so much light that the effect is
far more brilliant than if the design were
executed on glass in the usual manner.
The choreutoscope is not only a most amusing
contrivance, but it illustrates in a very beautiful
manner this optical law called ‘persistence
of vision.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h2>
</div>


<p>The best lantern and the best pictures will
not interest an audience unless the entertainer
or lecturer is up to his work, and the matter
which he conveys is skilfully put together.
I believe that lecturing would be far more
popular among us had it not been for the
numbers of utterly incompetent men who have
in past years bored audiences to such an extent
that the word ‘lecture’ is to them as a red rag
is to a bull. When I say incompetent men,
I do not mean uneducated ones; but I mean
those who from natural want of voice, and
utter ignorance of its management, are generally
unfit for public speaking. It seems to be
too often conceded that because a man has
written a book—or done something else which
has brought him before public notice—he is,
without any previous knowledge or practice,
fit to lecture on the particular subject with
which his name is identified. Or his claims
to recognition as a lecturer are based upon
certain cabalistic letters after his name, which
in many cases represent only so many guineas
yearly subscribed to those who confer them.
Lecturing is an art that can only be acquired
successfully by those who have certain qualifications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
for the work, and among these the
foremost is the power of imparting knowledge
to others in a common-sense and interesting
manner. Luckily for him, the amateur lecturer
is likely to meet with a far more indulgent
audience than those which professional men
have occasionally to face; but this is no reason
why he should be careless as to his method of
delivery, or of the matter delivered. Perhaps the
er—worst fault er—which a lecturer can er—fall
into—is the one indicated er—in this sentence.
‘To <i>err</i> is human,’ in a wider sense, unfortunately,
than Pope, the writer of that well-known
line, ever dreamt of. Unless a would-be
lecturer can conquer this tiresome habit, or
any other trick of speech which he may have
cultivated, by all means let him confine himself
to the management of the lantern while
some one else acts as showman.</p>

<p>If two people are thus managing an exhibition
between them, and if the room be
large, so that they are widely separated, some
signal from the lecturer to indicate that he wants
the next picture thrown on the screen becomes
necessary. A bell, or anything that makes
a noise, is distracting both to lecturer and
audience. Still worse are verbal instructions
from one to the other. I myself use an
electric single-stroke bell with the gong removed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the hammer of which gives a little
click unmistakable to the operator, but quite
unheard by the audience. Such a bell can be
placed close to the lantern, while its push is
far away on the lecturer’s desk. Sometimes a
string can be carried from lecturer to operator,
a gentle pull of which will give the necessary
signal. Some lecturers signal by uncovering
a little pane of red glass in the back of their
reading-lamp. But I think that any sight
signal is inadmissible, because the operator
has quite enough to do in attending to his
duties without having his attention thus distracted.
The signal, of whatever nature it
be, should be given by the lecturer some
seconds before he has finished with the
picture in hand, otherwise there is an awkward
pause while the operator makes the
necessary change. Before the lecture begins,
the reader should make himself not only
thoroughly familiar with his subject, but
should be also familiar with the different
pictures which illustrate it. And this especially
applies to the common case of those who have
purchased or hired a set of slides and a published
lantern reading—many of which are
compiled by writers of repute, and are in
every way excellent. Let him, then, carefully
go through the reading beforehand, comparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
each picture with the text, and making himself
so familiar with its details that he is afterwards
able, during performance, to point out
anything to which attention may advantageously
be directed. Particularly is this
necessary in the case of an introductory map,
where places of importance to the subject in
hand must be pointed out. The most convenient
form of pointer, by the way, is a
Japanese fishing-rod, which telescopes into
small compass when not in use.</p>

<p>For an evening’s lantern entertainment to
be successful, a great deal depends upon the
operator. With a mineral-oil lamp in a small
room, his duties are not very onerous, for the
lamp when once established should require no
further attention, except it be to turn down a
wick which shows symptoms of smoking. But
he should be careful to have in reserve a glass
or two to replace the front glass of the combustion-chamber,
which may crack through
some unexpected draught of air. His slides
must all be numbered and in order. They
may be each mounted in a wooden frame to
fit the lantern stage, or else the lantern may be
fitted with a permanent grooved slide in which
the glass pictures are placed one after another,
the last one pushing out the one before.
Another plan, which is a good one to adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
where a single lantern only is being used, is to
make use of what is called a panoramic slide.
It is constructed like the one just described,
only it is furnished with a travelling tape
upon which each picture rests. The turn of a
handle moves the tape, and the pictures travel
forward panorama-fashion.</p>

<p>In the use of a double lantern furnished
with lime-jets, there is plenty for two hands
to do, for the operator has to keep his attention
fixed not only upon the business of
changing the pictures, but upon the condition
of the lights. As the pressure of the oxygen
gas varies as it is gradually consumed, so the
supply of the two gases to the jets will want
constant adjustment if the maximum quantity
of light is expected. Extra weights, too,
must be added as the pressure-boards gradually
sink down. Beyond carefulness in this respect,
the lantern operator must see to the
occasional turning of his limes, taking care to
do this when the lime wanting attention is
not in actual use. He should also find time
to wipe the glass of each picture with a leather
before putting it in the lantern, for a film of
moisture condenses on the surface, particularly
in a room full of people.</p>

<p>The success of a lantern entertainment depends
nearly as much on the competence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the assistant as it does on the powers of the
lecturer. I am perhaps fastidious on this point,
for my lecturing apprenticeship was served at
the late Royal Polytechnic Institution, where
operators were employed who had spent the
best part of their lives in this particular work.
It was seldom, indeed, that they made a
mistake.</p>
